# A-Roll

A collection of video components for Remotion videos

## Installing

Run `npm i && npm run start`. To use a component copy it to another project. :)

## Rendering

`npx remotion render --gl=angle <composition> <outfile>`

Rendering doesn't work on a Mac M1 without `--gl=angle` because reasons.
